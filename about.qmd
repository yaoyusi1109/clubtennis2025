## Our Team

We may be a team of four, but we've got more C-level officers than a Fortune 500 company. Small but mighty—each member holds an executive title because, well, why not? Welcome to our perfectly over-titled squad:

**Yusi Yao – CTO (Chief Technology Officer)**  
Designs and implements the entire technical framework including both backend and frontend architecture. Developed the performance analysis system and Elo ranking ladder that powers the club's competitive tracking.

**Kempton von Glinsky-Gregoire – COO (Chief Operating Officer)**  
Manages client relationships and serves as the primary liaison with VT Club Tennis. Documents client requirements and translates them into actionable development tasks for the team.

**Caleb Ramsey – COO (Chief Operating Officer)**  
Develops financial and analytical tools for the project. Coordinates team activities and ensures all deliverables meet project timelines and quality standards.

**Parker Trahan – CIO (Chief Information Officer)**
