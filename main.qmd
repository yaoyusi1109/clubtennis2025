## B. Swing Vision Integration

- **Objective:** Leverage Swing Vision technology to provide players with personalized performance feedback.
- **Process:**

    - **Feedback Loop:** Generate concise feedback reports that identify one key area for improvement for each player.

## C. Doubles Pairing Analysis

- **Objective:** Use data to identify and recommend optimal doubles pairings.
- **Analysis:**
    - **Data Points:** Combine Swing Vision stats and match results to evaluate team chemistry.
    - **Metrics:** Analyze net vs. baseline play, serve/return dynamics, and overall win percentages for various pairings.
