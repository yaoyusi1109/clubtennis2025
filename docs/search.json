This chart shows how each player’s rating evolved through all 5 matches. The dashed line at 1300 is where everyone started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat This Shows: - Alice (Maroon): Started strong (won Match 1), dropped after upset loss to Charlie, recovered by winning rematch against Bob - Bob (Orange): Lost first match to Alice, upset Charlie, then lost to Alice again and Charlie - most volatile journey! - Charlie (Green): Stayed at 1300 for 2 matches, then upset Alice to jump up, lost to Bob, recovered by beating Bob again - Notice: The system rewards upsets with big point jumps (see Charlie’s jump in Match 2, Bob’s in Match 3)\n\n\n\n3.7 Visual: Final Win-Loss Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Observation: Alice and Charlie both ended at 1315 rating with 2-1 records, while Bob ended at 1269 with 1-3 record. This shows that who you beat matters more than just win count - Charlie’s upset of Alice earned big points!\n\n\n\n3.8 Key Insights from These Examples:\n\nEqual players (Match 1): 50-50 expected, winner gets +16, loser gets -16\nUpsets reward more points: Charlie and Bob gained 17+ points from their upsets\nClose matches: When ratings are nearly equal, point swings are around 16\nExpected wins: When the favorite wins, they gain fewer points (Match 5: +15)\nSystem stays balanced: Total points = 3900 (1300 × 3 players) throughout all matches\nWin-loss records don’t tell the whole story: Alice is 2-1 but ranked 1st, Bob is 1-3 but close to Charlie (2-1)"

    "text": "3 3. Let’s See It In Action: VT Club Tennis Roster Simulation\nWe’ll apply the Elo rating system to the actual VT Club Tennis men’s roster and simulate a season of matches to see how rankings evolve.\n\n3.1 Initial Roster\nHere are the 40 members of the VT Club Tennis men’s team, starting with their current ladder rankings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Match 1: Alice vs Bob (Both start at 1300)\n\n\n\nStarting Ratings - Everyone at 1300\n\n\nname\nrating\n\n\n\n\nAlice\n1300\n\n\nBob\n1300\n\n\nCharlie\n1300\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Match: - Alice: 1300 rating - Bob: 1300 rating - Expected Result: 50-50 (both equal)\nAlice wins!\nCalculation: - K-factor: 32 (both are new players) - Alice expected to win: 0.50 (50%) - Alice actually won: 1.0 (100%) - Point change: 32 × (1.0 - 0.50) = +16 points\n\n\n\nMatch 1 Results\n\n\nname\nold_rating\nexpected\nactual\nchange\nnew_rating\n\n\n\n\nAlice\n1300\n50%\nWon\n+16\n1316\n\n\nBob\n1300\n50%\nLost\n-16\n1284\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Match 1:\n\n\n\nCurrent Standings After Match 1\n\n\nrank\nname\nrating\n\n\n\n\n1\nAlice\n1316\n\n\n2\nCharlie\n1300\n\n\n3\nBob\n1284\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Match 2: Alice vs Charlie (Alice now favored)\nBefore Match: - Alice: 1316 rating (favorite) - Charlie: 1300 rating (underdog) - Expected: Alice should win 52% of the time\nCharlie wins! (UPSET)\nCalculation: - K-factor: 32 (both still new) - Charlie expected to win: 0.48 (48%) - Charlie actually won: 1.0 (100%) - Point change: 32 × (1.0 - 0.48) = +17 points (more than Match 1 because of the upset!)\n\n\n\nMatch 2 Results - Upset!\n\n\nname\nold_rating\nexpected\nactual\nchange\nnew_rating\n\n\n\n\nCharlie\n1300\n48%\nWon\n+16.7\n1316.7\n\n\nAlice\n1316\n52%\nLost\n-16.7\n1299.3\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Match 2:\n\n\n\nCurrent Standings After Match 2\n\n\nrank\nname\nrating\n\n\n\n\n1\nCharlie\n1316.7\n\n\n2\nAlice\n1299.3\n\n\n3\nBob\n1284.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Simulating a Season of Matches\nNow let’s simulate 200 random matches to see how the rankings evolve over time. The simulation assumes:\n\nPlayers closer in the ladder are more likely to play each other\nHigher-ranked players win more often, but upsets happen\nEvery match updates both players’ ratings using the Elo formula\n\n\n\n3.5 Final Rankings After 200 Matches\nHere’s how the ladder looks after the simulation. Notice how some players have moved significantly from their initial positions!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Rating Evolution for Top 10 Players\nThis chart shows how the ratings of the top 10 players evolved throughout the 200-match season:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7 Match Activity Summary\n\n\n\nTop 15 Most Active Players (by total matches played)\n\n\nPlayer\nTotal Matches\nWins\nLosses\nWin Rate (%)\n\n\n\n\nCarson Le\n37\n17\n20\n45.9\n\n\nNico Bermudez\n26\n11\n15\n42.3\n\n\nDiego Beltfort\n24\n14\n10\n58.3\n\n\nMitchell Freeman\n23\n13\n10\n56.5\n\n\nAustin Victory\n23\n9\n14\n39.1\n\n\nReed Kelly\n23\n14\n9\n60.9\n\n\nLuke Howell\n20\n12\n8\n60.0\n\n\nDavid Cho\n20\n13\n7\n65.0\n\n\nVaughn Harrington\n18\n9\n9\n50.0\n\n\nAndrew Kim\n18\n7\n11\n38.9\n\n\nRodrigo Lopez\n15\n7\n8\n46.7\n\n\nSarthak Vishwakarma\n14\n14\n0\n100.0\n\n\nEric Yoo\n12\n5\n7\n41.7\n\n\nNicola Cattaneo\n11\n9\n2\n81.8\n\n\nHarisharan Baskaran\n11\n6\n5\n54.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8 Key Insights from the Simulation\n\nRankings Changed: The simulation shows natural movement in the ladder as players compete\nHigher-Rated Players Win More: But upsets still happen, making the system dynamic\nActivity Matters: Players who played more matches had more opportunities to climb or fall\nElo is Self-Correcting: Over time, ratings stabilize to reflect true skill levels"
